 Its a webpage that asks you to enter number of persons and your budget.
 
 After filling the form it shows you list of dishes. Just checkmark dish and it will automatically calculate how much qunatity of that dish is required and what would be the total price of it.
 
 You can easily exceed number of dishes so that you can analyse how much dishes you can have in that budget

NOTE: Please note that I had visited various caterers shops but each shop has its own set of calculation. For example some said that 10kg rice is sufficient for 60 persons where as some said 10kg rice is sufficient for 100 persons. Some said that adding 2 same type dishes reduce the quantity of each dish. let say 2 types of rices then if its one then 10kg and if 2 same type dishes you'll go 8kg + 8kg. Some said go for 10kg + 10kg. So ultimately you need to alter this code as per your calculation

Currently it supports only 15 dishes per menu but will fix it later on (Just haven't added enough place holders)
